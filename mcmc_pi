"""
In this script I will show how to find a circle square
Firstly we need to know calculate a pi value

area of a circle => pi * r**2, where r- circle radius
area of a square => 2r * 2r = 4*r**2

ration of areas 

ratio = 4*r**2 / pi*r**2 = 4 / pi
then pi = 4 / ratio

The equation for a circle => x**2 + y**2 <= r**2 (all points inside a circle)
Otherwise, if x in [0, r] and y in [0, r] then if they are not in a circle, they are in a square
